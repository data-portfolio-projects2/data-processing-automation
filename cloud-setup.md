## ‚úÖ Here's how GitHub fits into your cloud-native setup:

### üîÅ End-to-End Flow:

*   **Kaggle Data Ingestion**
    *   Use Python scripts in your GitHub repo to:
        *   Authenticate with Kaggle API
        *   Download datasets
        *   Save them to a staging location (local or cloud like GCS)

*   **Data Staging (Cloud-native)**
    *   Use Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets to stage data instead of your local machine.
    *   Upload the CSVs via your script or GitHub Actions.

*   **Data Processing (Cleaning, Enriching)**
    *   Run your transformation/enrichment scripts either:
        *   Locally and push results to GCS/BigQuery
        *   Or trigger them via GitHub Actions using a Python environment

*   **Data Loading**
    *   Insert the cleaned/enriched data into BigQuery or another cloud database.

*   **Deployment and Scheduling**
    *   Use GitHub Actions to automate pipelines (e.g., daily ingestion ‚Üí clean ‚Üí load)
    *   Use Secrets for GCP service account authentication

### üß∞ GitHub Project Setup Components:

| File/Folder | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ingest_kaggle.py` | Downloads Kaggle dataset and uploads to GCS |
| `clean_data.py` | Reads raw data from GCS, cleans/transforms |
| `enrich_web_data.py`| Adds additional data from APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) |
| `load_to_bigquery.py`| Loads the final dataset into BigQuery |
| `.github/workflows/`| Contains CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions |
| `.env.example` | Example of required environment variables (Kaggle API, GCP creds) |
| `README.md` | Project documentation and setup instructions |
